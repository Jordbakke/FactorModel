Factor Model Project

Description: Ongoing, personal project that aims to create latent factors for stocks using multiple sources of financial data, including fundamentals, macro, and textual data. A siamese twin architecture and similarity between company embeddings are used to find such latent factors. Once embeddings are created for the companies in the used dataset, SVD is applied to find the latent factors.
